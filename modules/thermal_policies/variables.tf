  Sets the Fan Control Mode of the System. High Power, Maximum Power and Acoustic modes are only supported for Cisco UCS X series Chassis.
  * Acoustic - The fan speed is reduced to reduce noise levels in acoustic-sensitive environments. This Mode is only supported for UCS X series Chassis.
  * Balanced - The fans run faster when needed based on the heat generated by the server. When possible, the fans returns to the minimum required speed.
  * LowPower - The Fans run at the minimum speed required to keep the server cool.
  * HighPower - The fans are kept at higher speed to emphasizes performance over power consumption. This Mode is only supported for UCS X series Chassis.
  * MaximumPower - The fans are always kept at maximum speed. This option provides the most cooling and consumes the most power. This Mode is only supported for UCS X series Chassis.
